## 1. Itinerary Creation Initiation

**User Action:** Click on "New Itinerary" or tap the "+" icon on dashboard.

* **Possible Inputs:** Trip name, destination(s), dates, traveler count.
* **System Response:** Opens a parameter form.
* **Validation:** Checks required fields (e.g., destination not empty, date logic).
* **Edge Case:** Missing or invalid date → inline error messages.

---

## 2. Providing Initial Trip Parameters

**User Action:** Fill in form: destination, travel\_dates, interests, budget, pace (relaxed/packed).

* **System Validation:**

  * Date range overlap or past dates → prompt correction.
  * Budget out of realistic range → warning but allow override.

* **Alternative Path:** User uploads a rough outline (CSV or previous plan) → system ingests and pre-fills form.

---

## 3. AI Suggestion Generation

**AI Processing Steps:**

1. Fetch destination data (points of interest, typical duration).
2. Analyze user parameters (interests, pace, budget).
3. Run itinerary-generation model to propose day-by-day schedule.
4. Enrich with practical details (opening hours, transportation).

**System Response:**

* Display a draft itinerary overview with days, timings, and places.
* Show confidence levels or AI notes (e.g., "2h recommended at Louvre").

**User Interaction Options:**

* Accept entire draft.
* Dive into a specific day for granular edits.
* Regenerate suggestions (with toggles for pace or focus).

---

## 4. Itinerary Customization & Real-time Feedback

**Customization Mechanisms:**

* Drag & drop activities between days.
* Add new POIs or remove unwanted ones.
* Adjust start/end times via time pickers.
* Toggle alternative travel modes (walk, bus, train).

**Real-time Feedback Loop:**

* System re-computes timing conflicts.
* Highlights overlapping events in red.
* Provides alternate recommendations when slot freed.

**Constraints:**

* Cannot exceed daily time budget (e.g., 8–12h/day unless user overrides).
* Closed attractions filtered out automatically.

---

## 5. Saving & Managing Itineraries

**Save Mechanisms:**

* Auto-save draft after each modification.
* Manual "Save & Name" button for final versions.

**Management Options:**

* Itinerary dashboard: list view with thumbnails, tags (e.g., "Paris Summer").
* Actions: Edit, Duplicate, Delete, Share, Export (PDF/CSV).

**Multi-trip Handling:**

* Folder or tag-based organization.
* Filter by status: Draft, Published, Archived.

---

## 6. Sharing & Exporting

* **Share Links:** Generate a view-only web link.
* **Collaborators:** Invite others to view or co-edit.
* **Export Formats:** PDF (print-ready), CSV for spreadsheets, ICS calendar feed.

---

## User Personas & Use Cases

**Persona 1: Emily, the Spontaneous Solo Traveler**

* Wants a quick plan for a 3-day weekend in Lisbon.
* Uses defaults, reviews and saves within 2 minutes.
* Edge Case: Unpredictable weather → system suggests indoor alternatives.

**Persona 2: Raj & Priya, Family with Young Kids**

* Need kid-friendly attractions and midday breaks.
* Use customization to add park/playground slots.
* Edge Case: One-day bus strike → system flags public transport alerts.

---

## Potential Challenges & Mitigations

**Challenge 1:** Overwhelming number of suggestions.

* **Mitigation:** Progressive disclosure—show top 3, with "See more" toggle.

**Challenge 2:** AI misinterprets niche interests.

* **Mitigation:** Offer "Refine Interest" sliders and feedback prompts.

**Challenge 3:** Timing conflicts during customization.

* **Mitigation:** Real-time conflict detection and contextual tips.

---

**End-to-End Happy Path:**

1. User clicks New Itinerary → fills form → AI draft appears → user reviews → drags a museum to Day 2 → saves plan → shares link with friends.

This flow ensures clarity, flexibility, and control, making Travel Trove feel both intelligent and user-centric from conception to sharing.
