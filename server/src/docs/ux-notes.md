   - Avoid overwhelming users with too many choices at once

2. Clear Feedback
   - Confirm when preferences are saved
   - Show loading states during updates
   - Indicate which preferences affect what aspects of recommendations

3. Accessibility
   - Support keyboard navigation
   - Provide clear error messages
   - Maintain proper contrast ratios
   - Include descriptive labels and help text

## User Flow Steps
1. Initial Setup
   - Prompt new users to set preferences after account creation
   - Allow skipping initial setup (use defaults)
   - Save progress if user abandons setup

2. Preference Updates

   - Edit individual sections without redoing entire flow
   - Preview changes before saving

3. Preference Usage
